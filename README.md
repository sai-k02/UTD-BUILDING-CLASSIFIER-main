INTRODUCTION:
Getting lost on the first day of school is a fear shared by many. Incoming college students, freshman or transfer, often struggle with locating their classes and finding on-campus eateries. And if your university doesn’t provide you with a virtual map of its campus, you may be out of luck. Fortunately, UTD has provided its students with a campus map. Though, the map may seem puzzling due its ambiguity and the mobile UX. Thus, we decided to develop an IOS application to bolster the end-to-end experience users share with their handheld devices and the 3D world around UTD’s campus. 


WHAT HAVE WE CREATED:

Our app allows users to be able to take a photo or upload a photo of a building which will determine the name of the building at UTD  via machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

In the long run, our app aims to tackle the subset of drawbacks on the original UTD Services IOS application, and implement machine learning into the app. 

HOW IT WORKS:

We created a model by training it with specific phortos and recognize patterns via machine learning. So, Artificial Intelligence will use this training model to identify specific buildings/areas at UTD using many Apple’s Library’s. The task of image recognition involves the creation of a neural network that processes the individual pixels of an image to recognize a dog for example. And look’s for similarities in structure, color, curvature. So obviously, the more photos you can provide of the said object the better the model will be.


CHALLENGES: Nehanth:

The number of photos available on images.google is just not sufficient, so we had to genuinely go to UTD with a camera and take over 500 pictures
Properly implementing the ML model into the app
Apple has a very strict privacy policy due to the app needing camera/photo library access so we had to figure out a privacy policy/developer signing for camera access. 
Implementing S(casp) common sense reasoning with XCode/Swift

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
Successfully identify 11 buildings on UTD’s campus
Implementing ML model in our model with Swift, SwiftUI, Apple’s Vision Library,  
Successfully using S(Casp) common sense reasoning to be able to accomplish building classification via images

WHAT WE LEARNED:
Use Apple’s Vision Library, Create ML,Core ML XCode, and “S(Casp)” common sense reasoning to be able to accomplish building detection. We also learned app development, training a model inclusive of many augmentations(Blur, Upside Down, Etc.)
